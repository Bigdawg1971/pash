DESCRIPTION
    The OData PowerShell provider allows you to mount OData feeds as drives
	in your PowerShell session.
	
GETTING STARTED
	Mounting an OData Feed
		To mount an OData feed, use the new-psdrive PowerShell cmdlet, specifying
		the OData provider and the URI of the feed as the drive's root:

		new-psdrive -psprovider OData -name netflix -root 'http://odata.netflix.com/v2/Catalog/'

		Once this command is executed, your PowerShell session will have a netflix:
		drive available.  This drive can be used to interrogate the OData feed
		using the standard PowerShell provider cmdlets.

		For example:

		> cd netflix:
		> dir
		
			Container: OData::http:\\odata.netflix.com\v2\Catalog


				   Uri                      Name                    
		---------- ---                      ----                    
		d  <       http://odata.netflix.... Genres                  
		d  <       http://odata.netflix.... Titles                  
		d  <       http://odata.netflix.... TitleAudioFormats       
		d  <       http://odata.netflix.... TitleAwards             
		d  <       http://odata.netflix.... People                  
		d  <       http://odata.netflix.... TitleScreenFormats      
		d  <       http://odata.netflix.... Languages               

		> cd Genres
		> dir
